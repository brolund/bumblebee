
*** The history of Bumblebee
Bumblebee springs from the experiences from TDDoc, a documentation add-on to RMock. The ideas and concepts are pretty much the same, but the 
implementation approach is different. 

*** Projects using Bumblebee
    - [[http://www.dtangler.org/builds][dtangler]] - Follow the link to the top-most successful build, then =/documentation= 

*** Need more support?
Bumblebee is an open source project that I work on when I'm not consulting or otherwise tending my company 
[[http://www.agical.com][Agical]]. If you desperately need some feature, please contact me 
at daniel.brolund@agical.com and we'll work something out.
