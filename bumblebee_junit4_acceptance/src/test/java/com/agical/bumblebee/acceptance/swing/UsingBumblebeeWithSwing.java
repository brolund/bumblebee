    This section explains how to use Bumblebee to document a Swing application.
    The purpose could be to create a manual for the application, or to create a 
    domain tutorial using the application to exemplify.
    
    Bumblebee will have a simple DSL (Domain Specific Language) to 
    allow you do extract and manipulate screen-shots from the application,
    thus allowing you to robustly generate documentation for your 
    Java Swing GUI.
